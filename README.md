## ✨ Functionality

This project is a client-side Goal-Based Savings Planner built with React and Tailwind CSS. Below are the key features and custom functionalities I implemented:

### 🧩 1. Add & Manage Goals
- Users can create multiple financial goals with:
  - A name (e.g., "Trip to Japan")
  - Target amount
  - Currency (INR or USD)
- Each goal is displayed as a card showing:
  - Goal name
  - Original currency target
  - Converted amount in the other currency
  - Progress bar showing how much has been saved
  - A button to add contributions

### 📊 2. Dashboard Summary
- A top dashboard displays:
  - Total target (converted to USD)
  - Total saved amount
  - Overall progress (%) calculated as:  
    ```
    For each goal, progress is calculated as:

    progress = min((saved / target) × 100, 100)
    
    Then, overall progress is calculated as the average of all goal progress values:

    averageProgress = (sum of individual progress values) / number of goals

    If there are no goals, the overall progress is 0.
    
    ```
- This gives the user a clear overview of all their savings progress in one place.

### 💰 3. Add Contribution
- Users can click "Add Contribution" to input:
  - Amount to add
  - Date of contribution
- This updates the progress in real time.

### ✅ 4. Prevent Over-Contribution
- If the user tries to add more money than the goal's target:
  - The “Add Contribution” button gets disabled
  - This shows that the goal is fully achieved, and no extra money is needed

### 🔁 5. Real-Time Exchange Rate
- The app fetches live USD ↔ INR exchange rates from the ExchangeRate API
- Users can:
  - Manually update the rate using the “Refresh Rate” button
  - View the last updated time to check data freshness
- Both:
  - Dollar to INR
  - INR to Dollar conversions are supported and displayed clearly

### 🗑️ 6. Delete Goal Feature
- Users can delete any goal if no longer needed
- When deleted:
  - The goal and its data are removed from local storage
  - This ensures clean storage management (like clearing cookies)

### 🕓 7. View Contribution History
- Users can view the full history of contributions made to a goal
  - Each entry shows the date and amount
- This helps track saving habits over time

### 🧠 User Experience Enhancements
- Fully responsive layout — works on mobile and desktop
- Form validations to prevent:
  - Negative values
  - Empty fields
  - Invalid numbers
- Loading and error states handled gracefully
- Smooth, clean UI to make saving goals feel intuitive
